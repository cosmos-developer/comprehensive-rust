# Course Structure

> This page is for the course instructor.

## Rust Fundamentals

The six sessions make up [Rust Fundaments](../running-the-course/welcome-1.md).
The days are fast paced and we cover a lot of ground:

* Sessions 1 & 2: Basic Rust, syntax, control flow, creating and consuming values.
* Sessions 3 & 4: Memory management, ownership, compound data types, and the standard library.
* Sessions 5 & 6: Generics, traits, error handling, testing, and unsafe Rust.

## Format

The course is meant to be very interactive and we recommend letting the
questions drive the exploration of Rust!
