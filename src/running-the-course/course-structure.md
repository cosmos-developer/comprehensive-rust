# Course Structure

> This page is for the course instructor.

## Rust Fundamentals

The first three days make up [Rust Fundaments](../welcome-day-1.md).
The days are fast paced and we cover a lot of ground:

* Day 1: Basic Rust, syntax, control flow, creating and consuming values.
* Day 2: Memory management, ownership, compound data types, and the standard library.
* Day 3: Generics, traits, error handling, testing, and unsafe Rust.

## Format

The course is meant to be very interactive and we recommend letting the
questions drive the exploration of Rust!
